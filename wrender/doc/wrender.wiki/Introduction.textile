 A basic demo of a draft of Wrender (*proof of concept*). Note, this is very alpha and provided here to get community feedback on direction.

Wrender maintains two graphs--the graph of interest and an in-memory TinkerGraph that is actually visualized. The TinkerGraph is intended to be a subset of the larger graph.

Use Gremlin to grab portions of the backend graph and place into the in-memory TinkerGraph.

The "render" checkbox states that any vertices/edges that are returned by a Gremlin query are visualized (i.e. placed in the in-memory TinkerGraph)

Of course, simply do @$_g/V/outE@ to render the entire graph.
