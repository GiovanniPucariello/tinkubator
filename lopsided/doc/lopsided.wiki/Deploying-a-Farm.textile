This section will present information on deploying a Linked Process farm for the purpose of making a physical device a resource provider.

LoPSideD comes with an implementation of a farm (see @lopsided-farm@). Its possible to run a farm as a background process using the script @farm-nogui.sh@. This script can takes a confirguration file parameter. 

bc. marko$ ./farm-nogui.sh lanl_countryside.properties 

For an example of a configuration file, see "@lop-default.properties@":http://github.com/tinkerpop/lopsided/raw/master/lopsided-core/src/main/resources/org/linkedprocess/lop-default.properties. Moreover, see [[Managing Farm Permissions]] for information on the meaning of the variables in the configuration file. Setting the permissions correctly will ensure that a remote villein will not be able to corrupt the integrity of your system. Also, for private clouds, it may be desirable to loosen the default permissions in order to allow for more flexibility in what a villein can do with the resource provider (i.e. farm's underlying physical device).

For the remainder of this section, we will demonstrate a LoPSideD farm using the GUI version located in @lopsided-gui@. In @lopsided-gui@ is the script @farm-gui.sh@. Executing the script yields a login screen.

bc. marko$ ./farm-gui.sh

This login is identical to the login used by other XMPP clients like iChat, GTalk, etc. There is a username (client's bare JID), a password, an XMPP server (i.e. XMPP network service provider), and a port (i.e. the listening port of the XMPP server). However, unlike these other human chat-based XMPP clients, its possible to put a password on the farm in order to create a private Linked Process compute cloud. Once you have logged into your XMPP service provider's server, you will see that your farm is active.

In the example so far, the farm's countryside bare JID is @linked.process.1@@@lanl.linkedprocess.org@. The JID of the farm is @linked.process.1@@@lanl.linkedprocess.org/LoPFarm/SMQPA8R9@. Your farm is now active and ready to accept jobs from a villein. When a villein spawns a virtual machine off of your farm, you will see it underneath the farm in the GUI.
