The LoPSideD distributions comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) for a villein. This tool is useful for learning the Linked Process protocol and also for debugging Linked Process-enabled applications. Please see [[Deploying a Farm]] first before going through this tutorial. In order for the villein to work, it needs a farm to communicate with.

In practice, villein's will not be based on the villein GUI. Instead, a LoPSideD villein is developed as a Java application using the Villein API that comes with the LoPSideD distribution (see @lopsided-villein@). For the purpose of tutorial and debugging, the villein GUI is a useful tool (see @lopsided-gui@). To start up the villein GUI, use the following script.

bc. marko$ ./villein-gui.sh

The login is identical to any other XMPP client---there is a username (i.e. bare JID), a password, an XMPP server and port. Once you log into the XMPP service provider, a "buddy list" will be seen.

From the screenshot above, we see that our @linked.process.2@ account has 2 other accounts (countrysides) registered in their roster.[1] These two are @linked.process.1@ and @linked.process.3@. We see that there are farms on these accounts. Moreover, we see that @linked.process.1@ has 2 farms. It is possible for a single countryside to have many farms under it. That is, a single countryside can be the gateway to a cluster of machines as, in general, there is usually one farm per physical device in Linked Process. Finally, notice that the farm for @linked.process.3@ has a lock icon on it. This means that that farm requires a password in order to interact with it. In other words, its a private farm.

Lets spawn a virtual machine. Right-click on a farm and say "spawn". A list of virtual machines provided by that farm are made presented.

Once we have spawned a virtual machine, we will see it on our "buddy list". In the diagram below, we have spawned two virtual machines -- one on each of the farms of @linked.process.1@.

Double-click on the virtual machine icon (i.e. the tractor) and you will see a control window. This window will allow you to interact with the remote virtual machine in real-time.

You can submit code to the virtual machine (according to its language) and get back results. There are other features like managing bindings (i.e. variables) and pinging/canceling jobs. Feel free to play around with all the panels and options provided in the villein GUI to get a better understanding of the mechanics of the Linked Process protocol. Finally, for debugging purposes, the "packets" panel on all the GUIs displays the XMPP stanzas/packets that have flowed back and forth between the communicating entities.

In general, the villein GUI is useful for learning Linked Process and debugging clusters and applications. For developing Linked Process-enabled applications, please see [[Developing a Villein]].

fn1. You may have to right-click and say "probe" in order to probe the countryside for its active farms to get a list of available farms to show up in the GUI.
