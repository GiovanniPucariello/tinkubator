================================================================================
Part of LoPSideD: an implementation of the Linked Process Protocol

To start the LoPSideD farm GUI in Unix, use the Bash launcher script:

    $ bash farm-gui.sh config.properties

where config.properties is a Java properties file containing the configuration
of your LoPSiDeD environment.
Similarly, in Windows you may start a farm using the provided batch script:

    $ farm-gui config.properties

To launch the villein GUI, use

     $ bash villein-gui.sh config.properties

in Unix and

     $ villein-gui config.properties

in Windows.

To launch a farm without the LoPSideD graphical user interface, see the
lopsided-farm module of this project.
