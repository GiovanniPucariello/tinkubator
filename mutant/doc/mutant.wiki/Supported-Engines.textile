Mutant currently distributes with the following @ScriptEngine@ implementations. These engines are included through Mutant's "pom.xml":https://github.com/tinkerpop/mutant/blob/master/pom.xml @<dependencies/>@. Finally, note that currently, not all implementations of @ScriptEngine@ implement "JSR 223":http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223 correctly. This is a problem with the particular engines and not with Mutant. We have submitted bugs to respective engines with @ScriptEngine@ issues.
