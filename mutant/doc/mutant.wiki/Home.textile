Mutant supports the use of multiple "JSR 223":http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223 "ScriptEngines":https://scripting.dev.java.net/ over the same variable pool. In this way, its possible to make use of each language's unique expressive qualities when manipulating a collection of variables. Mutant can be seen as a ScriptEngine of ScriptEngines--a programming language of programming languages.[1]

```text

12
mutant[Groovy]> ?ruby
Switched to ruby
mutant[ruby]> x.to_s + " is a number."
12 is a number.
```
