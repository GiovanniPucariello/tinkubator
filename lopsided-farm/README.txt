Part of LoPSideD: an implementation of the Linked Process Protocol

To start a LoPSideD farm in Unix, use the Bash launcher script:

    $ bash farm-nogui.sh config.properties

where config.properties is a Java properties file containing the configuration
of your LoPSiDeD environment.
Similarly, in Windows you may start a farm using the provided batch script:

    $ farm-nogui config.properties

To launch a farm using the LoPSideD graphical user interface, see the
lopsided-gui module of this project.
